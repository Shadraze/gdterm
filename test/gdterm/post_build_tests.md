# Notes for post GitHub build verification

After merging all the source changes that go into the C++ binary builds, the
"Build Binaries" Action is run manually which builds the binaries for all the
different target types and loads them into the addons/gdterm/bin directory.

A final step is to verify everything ran smoothly by bringing down the result
into target systems and running a basic checkout of the plugin
